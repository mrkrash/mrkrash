### Hello there 💫😉

## Mario here!

I'm a Senor Backend Developer and I'm passionate about languages and paradigms; even to the social ones.

- 🔭 I’m currently studying Functional Paradigm and I'm looking to collaborate on projects to learn more
- 🌱 I think that languages do not delineate the developer's capability, there is a difference between a hammer and a screwdriver
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on projects in Dart, to learn more
- 📫 You can reach me on Mastodon.uno @marav
