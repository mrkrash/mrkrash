### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

## Mario here

I'm a Senor Backend Developer and I get passionate about languages and paradigms; even to the social ones.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying Functional Paradigm and I'm looking to collaborate on projects to learn more
- ğŸŒ± I think the language does not delineate the developer's capability, there is a difference between a hammer and a screwdriver
- ğŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on projects in Dart, to learn more
- ğŸ“« You can reach me on twetter @babau_mr
